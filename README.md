The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each successive number is the sum of the two previous numbers.  The sequence starts with 0, 1 and then proceeds with 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21 and so on. This sequence was discovered by Leonardo Fibonacci in the 13th century, but has many applications in mathematics, natural sciences, finance, and more. this program in python 3 calculates n numbers of the sequence, n is editable. 

Fibonacci sequence: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610, 987, 1597, 2584, 4181, 6765, 10946, 17711, 28657, ...

from the ratio between two successive terms of the sequence is obtained, less and less approximate, the golden section. I also added the golden_section function to show the progressive approximation of the golden section.   

Pascalâ€™s triangle is a mathematical figure representing binomial coefficients.  The triangle is formed by lines of numbers where each number is the sum of the two numbers above it in the previous line. The number of lines in the triangle can be changed.
